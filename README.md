This is a work-in-progress implementation of the knuth and plass line breaking algorithm in Rust. The goals are:

* learn Rust as a language
* explore parallel dynamic programming
* try to implement a parallel version of the knuth and plass line breaking algorithm
* benchmark it against non-parallel versions if possible
